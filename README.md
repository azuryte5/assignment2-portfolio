Challenge 2 for coding bootcamp 🐺
## Unique Comments

In mock up the project images become links to applications. I was trying to keep the title in the div without interfering with the link hitbox.

## Website

url of application: https://azuryte5.github.io/assignment2-portfolio/
url of repository:  https://github.com/azuryte5/assignment2-portfolio

## User Story
* AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria
* Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
* WHEN I load their portfolio
[✔️]THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
[✔️]THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
[✔️]THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
[✔️]THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* WHEN I click on the images of the applications
[✔️]THEN I am taken to that deployed application
* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
[✔️]THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
